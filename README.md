-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The colour used in this project is green - specifically #269014. I picked this colour because it is often used in food related websites and it is also a warm and very friendly colour to look at. 
        
    -   #### Typography
        -   The font-family "Josefine Sans" is the one used for the logo. For the website content the font-family used is "Open Sans". Sans Serif is the fallback font used in case  'Josefin Sans' and/or "Open Sans" are not being imported into the project correctly.
